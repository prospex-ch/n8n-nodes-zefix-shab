Access and terms
================

SHAB
----

Open. No account, no key. The API caps a request at 2,000 publications and
refuses a search offset above 10,000. :doc:`Publications <publications>` covers
how the node reads a date range across those limits.

The node sends at most one request per second, waits 30 seconds for an answer,
retries four times with a backoff that doubles from 0.5 seconds to a 30-second cap, and
identifies itself with a ``User-Agent`` carrying this repository's URL.

Zefix
-----

Needs the Basic credentials described in :doc:`install`. The node paces it at
one request every 0.5 seconds and retries a 429 or a 5xx three times, backing
off up to 30 seconds.

A run of failed retries throws, so an empty result always means the company is
absent from the register.

LINDAS and redistribution
-------------------------

The register data behind Zefix is also published as linked data through LINDAS,
under terms the Federal Office of Justice states on `the Zefix site
<https://www.zefix.admin.ch/en/search/entity/welcome>`_. Read those before
redistributing bulk extracts.

Watching the whole register
---------------------------

`Prospex <https://prospex.ch>`_ reads every filing in the register and joins it
to hiring, funding and web signals, then says which of those changes is worth a
call. The trigger on a daily schedule covers the UID list you already have.
